# ðŸŽ¬ Embedded Lore & Film References

The following moments and quotes from *Margin Call* are embedded into the simulator:

- `"The music's stopped, and we're still dancing."` â€” VaR assumptions fail under stress.
- `"The model shows we've crossed thresholds 27 times..."` â€” VaR limits repeatedly breached.
- `"If the assets drop by 25%... we're wiped out."` â€” Leverage sensitivity.

All lore moments are tied to simulation events using the `lore_print()` utility.
